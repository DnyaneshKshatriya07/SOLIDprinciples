The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that aim to guide software developers in writing maintainable and scalable code. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and represent a collection of best practices for object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should only have one responsibility.
   - This principle promotes the idea that a class should focus on doing one thing and doing it well, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - This encourages developers to design systems in a way that allows new functionality to be added without altering existing code. This is typically achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   - In simpler terms, if a class is a subtype of another class, it should be able to replace its parent class without affecting the behavior of the program. This ensures that derived classes adhere to the contract established by their base classes.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
   - This principle encourages the creation of small, specific interfaces, rather than large, monolithic ones. Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   - This principle emphasizes the importance of relying on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations. This makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain by decoupling high-level modules from low-level modules.

By adhering to these SOLID principles, developers aim to create code that is more modular, flexible, and easier to understand and maintain. These principles contribute to the overall goal of building robust and scalable software systems.
